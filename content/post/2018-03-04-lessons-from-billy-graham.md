One of the lessons that I have learned by reading about Billy Graham's life can apply to all lives.

> Focus like a laser, not a flashlight. 
(Michael Jordan)

* focus on the evangelism...could have left his ministry to be an actor and a politician, but he stayed committed to what he was called to do.
* focus on jesus...instead of any particular theology or racial bias.  he welcomed everyone with the simple message of the cross and many now praise him for his stances.
